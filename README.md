A Glucose Drip Monitoring System has been developed using minimal number of circuit components, using the techniques of microcontroller based embedded system design.It can be used for monitoring the drip rate of Glucose at hospital level .It is designed to operate with varying supply voltage from the battery without needing a regulator in order to conserve power.

Here the sensor assembly is clipped around the drip chamber which senses the fluid drops in it. The load sensor which is assembled weighs the glucose level in the drips bottle continuously. Once the value of the load level goes below a certain threshold an alert message will be immediately sent wirelessly to the monitoring/caring Centre using a Wi-Fi module.

Meanwhile the hall flow sensor monitor the flow rate of the drips. This flow rate can be controlled using a solenoid valve.

An android application is developed at the later stage such that the flow rate can be monitored and controlled wirelessly.

Andriod application has been developed used MIT app inventor application and project is attached in the repo.

Complete setup is not available in this repo. Only the main code used in cc3200 is available, please refer to the report for full project information.
